# BirthdayDatabase

Using basic MVC model, I followed the guidelines of Lab 9 in CS50x instructions which links the database of birthdays.db to the flask server running python on the back end and utilizing CSS and HTML on the front end.

style.css is the static file which contains the styling of the webpage.

app.py is the back end python which enters the name and birthdays into the database.

flask is hosting the actual server rather than using HTTP port.

index.html is the framework home page.
